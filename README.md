# WashingMachine
PROJECT: “Washing machine” 

You are required to implement a washing machine with 2 stages:
1. Stage 1 is for rinsing the water.
2. Stage 2 for spinning the clothes.

Tasks:

1) The user needs to start the washing machine using a button or any
equivalent.
2) The washing machine should pump the water using a water pump for a
specific amount of time from your choice and then the water pump stops
after that time and this is marked as stage 1. Moreover, you should switch on
a LED to determine that we are in stage 1.
3) The washing machine should spin the clothes using a motor after stage 1 is
finished automatically. This should be indicated using another LED than that
used in stage 1.
4) You should have a stop button to stop the washing machine.
